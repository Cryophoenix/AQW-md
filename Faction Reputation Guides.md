This document will be updated as I go on but I intend to have this page be dedicated for guides to reach Rank 10 for each faction reputation. Some factions may have the option for several methods for each reputation.

# Good Reputation

You can reach Rank 10 Good Reputation through multiple means, I will list some of the more faster known methods:
- Doing either [Good Company](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) or [The Sky Opens](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) from Lady Celestia at [/terminatemple](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/termina-temple)
	- [Good Company](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) can be completed by defeating the Termina Defenders in the map.
	- [The Sky Opens](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) can be completed by heading to [/etherwardes](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/etherstorm-war-desoloth) and killing any of the Dragon Warriors.
- Alternatively you can do the [Paradise is Not So Nice](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/alina-s-quests#2) and kill the Bird of Paradise at [/manor](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/manor).

# Blade of Awe Reputation

This is quite a simple faction and just completing the Blade of Awe quests should give you high reputation.

- You can increase Blade of Awe reputation by completing the [Find the Handle!](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/valencia-s-quests#3) quest till you are Rank 10. This shouldn't take very long as it gives 11,000 Reputation and with a rep boost this goes higher.
	- Drops from any elemental monster.
	- Travel to [/gilead](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/ruins-of-great-gilead) and kill any elementals you find till you get the drop.
