# Welcome to the site

This is going to be an attempt at making a somewhat updated version of AQWG. Most of the guides here will be checked through members of the community, if you find any mistakes or want to contribute please contribute via [this repository](https://github.com/Shell1010/AQW-md). The repository contains the markdown for this site (not the actual code), which I will be updating.

[[Newbie Guide]] - For returning players and new players, or even those who want a quick refresher!

[[Basic Class Guide]] - This guide generally reflects the popular enhancement choice for each class, how to obtain it, as well as a sort of progression of what classes to obtain at different stages of the game.

[[Levelling Guide]] - Showcasing some farming areas to level up fast.

[[Gold Guide]] - Showcasing some areas to gain gold fast.

Remember to also follow the [AQW Wiki](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/) as it updated constantly with information regarding the new releases and is the best resource for anything and everything AQW related.
