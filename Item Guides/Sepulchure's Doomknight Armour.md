Main prerequisite before all this is that you have Rank 10 Doomknight in your inventory in order to do the **”The Doom the Looms”** quest. You also need to be member to even start this questline, but the armour itself is non-mem.

You can start the questline at [/necropolis](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis) from Vayle. 

Like this yes

---
- **”Sepulchure’s Armour”**
	- Grab the [DoomKnight Hood](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/doomknight-hood) from the doomknight shop in [/shadowfall]([Shadowfall](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadowfall))
	- [40x Dark Spirit Orb](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-spirit-orb) 
		- Obtained from doing the Dark Spirit Orbs quest
	- To do this, repeat the **”Dark Spirit Orbs”** quest

- **”Dark Spirit Orbs”**
	- Get the [Shadow Serpent Scythe](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadow-serpent-scythe) from [/bludrut4](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/bludrut-keep-4)
	- Go to [/bludrut2](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/bludrut-keep-2) and defeat the shadow creeper till they drop [Shadow Creeper Enchant](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadow-creeper-enchant) 
	- Then head to [/marsh](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/marsh) and kill the witches for shadow whiskers x6

 Keep [Experimental Dark Item](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/experimental-dark-item) as you’ll need it later.

Next do **”The Doom that Looms”** this requires you to have Doomknight Rank 10, either the AC version or Member version. Whichever you pick.

Next you need to farm **100 Dark Spirit Orbs**. You can do either the **”Dark Spirit Orbs”** quest from before. Or two new options **”Trolling with Terror”** and **”A Penny for your Foughts”**. 

- **”Trolling with Terror”**
	- Head to [/battleundera](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/battle-under) and get the [Shadow Terror Axe](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadow-terror-axe) 
	- [Elders' Blood](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/elders-blood) from [/arcangrove](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/arcangrove) quest
	- This is basically a daily quest

- **”A Penny for your Foughts”**
	- [DoomCoin](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/doomcoin) x20 from [/maul](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/chopping-maul) 
	- Probably fastest way of doing this, it’s quite a braindead farm too

Now complete the **”Dark Spirit Donation”** quest. Get the [Dark Skull](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-skull) from [/necrocavern](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis-cavern).

--- 

The hardest part of the farm begins now. Farm **10,518 Dark Spirit Orbs** using previous methods. You also need to make sure you do the **”Hard Core Metals”** daily 3 times, gathering the **Arsenic, Chromium and Rhodium** metals.

- **”Hard Core Metals”**
	- Head to [/stalagbite](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/stalagbite-location) and kill the balboa’s
	- They’ll drop the items for quests

After obtaining the **10,518 Dark Spirit Orbs** you can now begin doing the **Hexed Metals** quests. 

---

The quests are all the same, except that you swap for the other metal each time. Start with **”Accursed Arsenic Hex”**

- **”Hexed Metal Quests”**
	- Gather Dark Energy at [/alliance](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/alliance)
	- Metal of choice
	- [Dark Spirit Orb](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-spirit-orb) from previous quests
	- Get deadly nightshade from seed spitters in [/arcangrove](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/arcangrove)


Get **Accursed Arsenic** from doing the **”Metals of Doom”** quests. You only need to do this once, first kill bats in [/dwarfhold](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dwarfhold-keep) to get the forge key. Then head to geopetal and she’ll merge it for you. 

Once you have completed one of the **”Metals of Doom”** quests you can merge your remaining **10,500 Dark Spirit orbs** into **5 Corrupt Orbs** and **2 Ominous Orbs** using the [Doom Merge](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/doom-merge-1) .
