Main prerequisite before all this is that you have Rank 10 Doomknight in your inventory in order to do the **”The Doom the Looms”** quest. You also need to be member to even start this questline, but the armour itself is non-mem.

You can start the questline at [/necropolis](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis) from Vayle.
