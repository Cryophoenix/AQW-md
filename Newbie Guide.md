# Settings

# User Interface

![[Pasted image 20240605215029.png]]

- The box in the top left of your screen shows your characters username. The red bar shows the player health (HP), you lose health by being attacked or through specific class skills.
- The text below the username tells you the class you are currently using, as well as the rank.
- The blue bar shows your mana (MP), this is used for your skills usually.
- The green bar is the stamina bar which is used for quick bursts of speed by tapping the space bar (default keybind) and clicking on a location.
- Clicking the yellow exclamation mark brings up the quest tracker.
	- If you have "Quest Pinner" setting turned on in the Advanced settings and quests are pinned, you will be able to see the quests.
- Clicking the bag on the bottom of the portrait opens up the Item drops UI.
- The number to the right of this shows you the level of the character.
- The skull icon on the top right hides monsters, this can be useful during quests where you are tasked to collect map items.
- Above the exclamation mark icon there is a gold coin, if you hover your mouse over this icon you will see that a Gold boost is active and it will tell you the time before it expires. There is an associated icon for each respective boost.


![[Pasted image 20240605220121.png]]

- This is the chat UI. This is where you will see messages from other players and be able to communicate to other players through the chat. Sometimes you will see system messages and announcements from in-game staff.


![[Pasted image 20240605220549.png]]

- This is the skills UI. It shows you the skills you can use. By hovering over each skill you can view the detailed description for it. This will show the cooldown duration as well as what sort of effects this skill does.

![[Pasted image 20240605220340.png]]

# Classes

Getting the classes below is only a suggestion. This isn't necessarily the only way to play the game, they are just intended for reaching endgame somewhat smoothly.

Any enhancement recommendations I reference here will be from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wupDvLuPnRC0fF0aNPc7rzrri7X1YcYy7S2s5Z6o_F4/edit#gid=181595567), with thanks to the following people:
