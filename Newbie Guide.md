# Settings

- Other - Opens a slider for the volume of Other sound effects.
- Camera Tool - Opens a UI where you can change the pose of your hero, perform emotes, checkout skill animations, change player scaling and other features. Useful for screenshots.

## Advanced Options

Here are a list of recommended advanced options to enable to enhance your gameplay:

- Allow Quest Log Turn-Ins - You are now able to complete quests via the questlog, instead of walking all the way back to the NPC
- Auto-Untarget Dead Targets - Automatically untarget enemies that are dead
- Auto-Untarget Self - Prevents you from targetting yourself, for example when you use a support skill without attacking an enemy
- Character Select Screen - Optional setting but makes login easier and you can select between multiple characters if you have alts.
- Chat settings 
- Disable Red messages - So your entire chat doesn't get filled when you spam a skill on cooldown
- Chat UI
- Class Actives/Auras UI - You can view auras/buffs/debuffs underneath the player portrait UI and enemy portrait UI. 
- Custom drops UI - A less intrusive UI for drops
- Invert menu
- Opened menu

- Quest Pinner - Being able to now pin quests, using the exclamation mark by the player portrait to access pinned quests.
- Reaccept Quest after turn-in - Optional, this is optimal for farming situations where you are required to accept a quest multiple times. Alongside Quest Log turn-ins you can complete quests while you continue to farm.
- Visual Skill CDs - Shows cooldown interval when a skill is on cooldown.


# User Interface

![[Pasted image 20240605215029.png]]

- The box in the top left of your screen shows your characters username. The red bar shows the player health (HP), you lose health by being attacked or through specific class skills.
- The text below the username tells you the class you are currently using, as well as the rank.
- The blue bar shows your mana (MP), this is used for your skills usually.
- The green bar is the stamina bar which is used for quick bursts of speed by tapping the space bar (default keybind) and clicking on a location.
- Clicking the yellow exclamation mark brings up the quest tracker.
	- If you have "Quest Pinner" setting turned on in the Advanced settings and quests are pinned, you will be able to see the quests.
- Clicking the bag on the bottom of the portrait opens up the Item drops UI.
- The number to the right of this shows you the level of the character.
- The skull icon on the top right hides monsters, this can be useful during quests where you are tasked to collect map items.
- Above the exclamation mark icon there is a gold coin, if you hover your mouse over this icon you will see that a Gold boost is active and it will tell you the time before it expires. There is an associated icon for each respective boost.


![[Pasted image 20240605220121.png]]

- This is the chat UI. This is where you will see messages from other players and be able to communicate to other players through the chat. Sometimes you will see system messages and announcements from in-game staff.


![[Pasted image 20240605220549.png]]

- This is the skills UI. It shows you the skills you can use. By hovering over each skill you can view the detailed description for it. This will show the cooldown duration as well as what sort of effects this skill does.

 
# Points and Currency
 
These are the main point and currency systems in the game as of right now:

![[Pasted image 20240605222629.png]]
- Experience Points (XP)
	- To level up, you gain XP by defeating enemies and completing quests. The level limit is 100 at the time of creating this guide. The amount of XP you gain is based on the enemies level.
	- Shown as a progress bar, to the right of the Gold. When hovered displays the amount required to the next milestone.

![[Pasted image 20240605220340.png]]
- Class Points (CP)
	- Similar to XP but this is used to rank up your class. By ranking up your class you gain new skills and passives. The max rank for any class is Rank 10. The amount of CP you gain is based on the enemies level.
	- Shown as a progress bar, to the left of the Gold. When hovered displays the amount required to the next milestone.

![[Pasted image 20240605222721.png]]
- Reputation Points (RP)
	- This is obtained from completing quests for particular factions. By ranking up your faction reputation, you will unlock rewards, and some classes in this game require Rank 10 with certain factions, the highest possible rank.
	- Shown when clicking on the portrait UI in the top left, and selecting "Reputation". This will open up a scrollable window with your reputation per faction. When hovered displays the amount required to the next milestone.

![[Pasted image 20240605222902.png]]
- Gold
	- This is the base currency in the game, it is obtained from killing monsters, completing quests, selling items and is used in many shops.
	- Shown below the Skills UI, indicating the amount of Gold.

![[Pasted image 20240605223103.png]]
- Adventure Coins (ACs)
	- This is the premium currency for AQW. They are required to get certain items or some classes in the game. Around 1000 ACs are given out for free each year, and even more so during certain events like Frostval.
	- Shown when opening your inventory.

# Story/Progression

I'll try to outline some goals you should accomplish during different parts of the game. There are quite a lot of things you can do and there is no *best* way to play this game but this guide will try to help you reach endgame somewhat smoothly.

At the very start of the game focus on completing the 13 Lord of Chaos storyline. Generally it is a good idea to level up to 30 so that bosses are not too difficult for you at this stage of the game. Please refer to the [[Levelling Guide]] and [[Gold Guide]] if needed. 

Also it is suggested at this stage of the game to get yourself 1 farming class and 1 soloing class for the purpose of clearing bosses and quests. These classes are not necessarily going to be your best options but used to farm better endgame classes. Please refer to the [[Basic Class Guide]] for more info.

In the mean time you should also focus on completing the Blade of Awe. Read this [[Blade of Awe Guide]]

*I feel like I should add more text here but I don't actually know what else to write about someone help*

Once you have finished with the 13 Lord of Chaos Saga I would suggest starting to get two of the most useful endgame classes, Archpaladin and Lord of Order. These two classes will be your entry into Ultras and will stick with you long into the endgame.

You can actually do both of these farms at the same time, as Lord of Order is simply daily quests and archpaladin can be completed within a day or two.
- [[Lord of Order Guide]]
- [[Archpaladin Guide]]

Items you should also farm in the mean time:
- [[Awescended]]
- [[Blinding Light of Destiny]]
- [[Drakath Armour]]
