## User Interface

- The box in the top left of your screen shows your characters username. The red bar shows the player health (HP), you lose health by being attacked or through specific class skills.
- The text below the username tells you the class you are currently using, as well as the rank.
- The blue bar shows your mana (MP), this is used for your skills usually.
- The green bar is the stamina bar which is used for quick bursts of speed by tapping the space bar (default keybind) and clicking on a location.
- Clicking the yellow exclamation mark brings up the quest tracker.
	- If you have "Quest Pinner" setting turned on in the [Advanced Settings](settings.md) and quests are pinned, you will see the remaining quests.
- Clicking the bag on the bottom of the portrait opens up the Item drops UI.
- The number to the right of this shows you the level of the character.
- The skull icon on the top right hides monsters, this can be useful during quests where you are tasked to collect map items.
- Above the exclamation mark icon there is a gold coin, if you hover your mouse over this icon you will see that a Gold boost is active and it will tell you the time before it expires. There is an associated icon for each respective boost.
